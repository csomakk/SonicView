# SonicView

Plan is to make this faster and better than Mac QuickView. Problem with it is that by pressing left arrow, i always lose my progress instead going back.


# Todo
* full screen
* next-prev step with arrow
* cache next-prev
* rotate and save image
* hide/show path to image
* retina support
* zoom with touchpad / scroll
