# SonicView

Plan is to make this faster and better than Mac QuickView. Problem with it is that by pressing left arrow, i always lose my progress instead going back.

# features
* full screen (enter / double click)


# Todo
* folder img count [xx/yy]
* next-prev step with arrow
* transparent images
* cache next-prev
* rotate and save image
* hide/show path to image
* retina support
* zoom with touchpad / scroll
* popup menu
