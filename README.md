# SonicView

Plan is to make this faster and better than Mac QuickView. Problem with it is that by pressing left arrow, i always lose my progress instead going back.

# features
* full screen (enter / double click)
* change background: `B` -- useful for transparent images

# Todo
* cache next-prev
* rotate and save image
* hide/show path to image
* retina support
* zoom with touchpad / scroll
* popup menu
